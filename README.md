# A SKOS vocabulary for the catalysis disciplines

> **The first collection of terms was just published (June-2023)**.
> **We will add more content in the coming weeks and month.**

The vocabulary has been created and maintained as part of the [NFDI4Cat](http://www.nfdi4cat.org) initiative and follows our [Voc4Cat Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7669183).

This repository was created from the template [voc4cat-template](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-template).
It uses the [voc4cat-tool](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-tool) and GitHub features like pull requests, gh-actions, gh-pages etc. to reduce the maintenance workload for contributors and editors.

## Basic principles

The process to contribute to the **voc4cat vocabulary** is as follows:

- get and update the vocabulary file (xlsx),
- submit a pull request with the updated file,
- collaborate on the pull request with editors or other github users,

After approval your pull request is ready to be merged by the editors. The merge will include your contribution into the SKOS-vocabulary file in the `vocabularies`-folder and it will also be reflected in the documentation that is automatically updated.

- The vocabulary `voc4cat` is documented at [https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat/voc4cat/](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat/voc4cat/)

## Contributing to vocabularies

To discuss about the **voc4cat**-vocabulary maintained here, create an [issue](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/issues).

To contribute new concepts or collections or change existing ones, you may either submit your contributions as Excel/xlsx-file or (as an expert) as new/changed turtle file.

> *To try out the workflow with some example data, you may use  [voc4cat-playground](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-playground) which is almost identical to this repository but is not meant to last.*

Here are the steps for submitting updates in Excel.

- Get the Excel/xlsx-vocabulary file
  - The latest version of the vocabulary is always available via github-pages.
    - The xlsx-file for `voc4cat` can be downloaded from [https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat/voc4cat.xlsx](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat/voc4cat.xlsx)
- Make changes to the Excel file
- Add the xlsx file to your clone of the repository into the folder `inbox-excel-vocabs`
  - The name of the file must match the vocabulary that you want to update. So do not change the filename, but keep `voc4cat.xlsx`.
- Create a pull request with the updated Excel-file in this repository.
  - Please describe your changes and the motivation for the changes in the pull request note or link to an issue with this information. This will help reviewers to understand the proposed change and decide about it.
- Your pull request will be processed automatically by a CI/CD pipeline that typically runs less than a minute.
- Review the artifacts/logs generated by the CI pipeline.
  - The [workflow artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts) will contain an updated xlsx file that is recreated from the updated turtle-file.
- If all is good your contribution will be either
  - directly merged by the maintainers
  - or a discussion will be started about what else is needed
  - or why the proposed change may not fit.
- If you need to fix something update the pull request branch. This will trigger the pipeline to run again.

Finally, when the proposed merge request is accepted, your changes will be integrated in the vocabulary in the folder [vocabularies](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat/tree/main/vocabularies). The vocabulary is stored in split form using a folder of turtle files. Each concept, collection and concept scheme is stored in a separate file using the ID-part of the IRI as file name.

See [inbox-excel-vocabs/README.md](inbox-excel-vocabs/README.md) for a minimal example how to test the submission process.

## How to suggest improvements to the tooling & template?

To discuss about the workflow for maintaining SKOS vocabularies based on this template, create an [voc4cat-template issue](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-template/issues).

To discuss about the tool that converts Excel to SKOS in gh-actions of this template, create an [voc4cat-tool issue](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-tool/issues).
