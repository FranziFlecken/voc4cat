# voc4cat - Vocabularies for Catalysis

This project is used to create and maintain SKOS-vocabularies for catalysis. It is maintained as part of the [NFDI4Cat](http://www.nfdi4cat.org) initiative.

It uses the [voc4cat-tool](https://gitlab.fokus.fraunhofer.de/nfdi4cat/ta1-ontologies/heterogen-synth) and CI-automation to reduce the workload for contributors and editors.


# Contributing

To discuss about the SKOS vocabularies maintained here, feel free create an [issue](https://gitlab.fokus.fraunhofer.de/nfdi4cat/ta1-ontologies/voc4cat/-/issues) in this repository.

To contribute concrete new vocabularies or change existing ones, you may either submit your contributions as Excel-file or (as an expert) as new/changed turtle file. The steps for submitting updates in turtle are not different from contributing source code to other gitlab repositories.

Here are the steps, for submitting updates in Excel.
  - Get the Excel-vocabulary file
    - For an existing vocabulary, download the last version of the vocabulary from ? (to-be-decided)
    - For a new vocabulary, use the template from the templates-folder.
 - Add your changes to the Excel file
 - Create a merge request with the updated Excel-file. 
   - The name of the Excel-file must match the vocabulary that you want to update (e.g. catvoc.xlsx to update a vocabulary named "catvoc"). 
   - New vocabularies will be named like the Excel-file (minus the .xlsx-extension).
 - Your merge request will be processed automatically by a CI/CD pipeline.
 - Review the artifacts/logs generated by the CI pipeline.
 - If all is good your contribution will be either
   - directly merged by the maintainers 
   - or a discussion will be started about what else is needed 
   - or why the proposed change may not fit.

If you like to discuss or contribute to the voc4cat-tool that is used here or have bug reports about it, please do not create an issue here but in the [voc4cat-tool](https://gitlab.fokus.fraunhofer.de/nfdi4cat/ta1-ontologies/heterogen-synth/-/issues) repository.
